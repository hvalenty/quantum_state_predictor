## Quantum State Predictor
This course was taught by Dr. Theodore Corcovilos @corcoted, who presented the class with the Quantum State Guessing Game. The game utilized the computer picking a random quantum spin-1/2 state from a predetermined list. The players (student teams) request measurements in the form of the Pauli operators Sx, Sy, or Sz and attempt to guess the state. But before the game, more on quantum properties.

## Our Task
Ultimately, our team (Rebecca Nelson, Duq '22 and myself) had to develop an algorithm to get the best possible score in the game, and especially beat the other team. The algorithm is a deterministic set of rules that could only take spectific inputs, while producing the outputs:

*   Which direction of measurement to request
*   When to guess and what state to guess

## Methods
Bayesian Estimation

## Results
We won!
